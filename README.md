## What is the Knight's Tour?
The Knight's Tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. This visualizer uses Warnsdorf's rule as a heuristic to solve the Knight's Tour problem. Warnsdorf's rule suggests choosing the move that has the fewest onward moves. This visualizer demonstrates the solution using a 3D interactive interface.

## Features
- 3D visualization of the chessboard using React Three Fiber
- Smooth animations powered by React Spring
- Implementation of Warnsdorf's rule for efficient solution finding
